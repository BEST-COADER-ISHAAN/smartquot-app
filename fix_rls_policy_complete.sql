  # Complete RLS Policy Fix for Products Table

  This script completely fixes the RLS policy issue that's preventing product imports.
  
  Problem: RLS policy is too restrictive and prevents batch imports
  Solution: Make the policy more permissive for authenticated users while maintaining security
