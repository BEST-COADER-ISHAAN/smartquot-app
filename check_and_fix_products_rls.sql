  # Check and Fix Products RLS Policies
  
  This script first checks what policies exist, then fixes them comprehensively.
*/

-- Step 1: Check current RLS status
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename = 'products' 
AND schemaname = 'public';

-- Step 2: Show ALL existing policies on products table
SELECT 
    tablename,
    policyname,
    cmd,
    permissive,
    roles,
    qual,
    with_check
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'products'
ORDER BY policyname;

-- Step 3: Show ALL triggers on products table
SELECT 
    tgname as trigger_name,
    tgrelid::regclass as table_name,
    proname as function_name
FROM pg_trigger t
JOIN pg_proc p ON t.tgfoid = p.oid
WHERE tgrelid = 'products'::regclass;

-- Step 4: Drop ALL policies on products table (comprehensive cleanup)
DO $$
DECLARE
    policy_record RECORD;
BEGIN
    FOR policy_record IN 
        SELECT policyname 
        FROM pg_policies 
        WHERE tablename = 'products' 
        AND schemaname = 'public'
    LOOP
        EXECUTE format('DROP POLICY IF EXISTS %I ON products', policy_record.policyname);
        RAISE NOTICE 'Dropped policy: %', policy_record.policyname;
    END LOOP;
END $$;

-- Step 5: Drop ALL triggers on products table
DO $$
DECLARE
    trigger_record RECORD;
BEGIN
    FOR trigger_record IN 
        SELECT tgname 
        FROM pg_trigger 
        WHERE tgrelid = 'products'::regclass
    LOOP
        EXECUTE format('DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS %I ON products', trigger_record.tgname);
        RAISE NOTICE 'Dropped trigger: %', trigger_record.tgname;
    END LOOP;
END $$;

-- Step 6: Create a very simple permissive policy for all operations
CREATE POLICY "Allow all authenticated users full access"
  ON products FOR ALL TO authenticated
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Step 7: Verify the fix
DO $$
DECLARE
  policy_count integer;
  trigger_count integer;
BEGIN
  -- Count policies on products table
  SELECT COUNT(*) INTO policy_count
  FROM pg_policies 
  WHERE tablename = 'products';
  
  IF policy_count = 1 THEN
    RAISE NOTICE 'SUCCESS: 1 permissive policy created for products table';
  ELSE
    RAISE NOTICE 'WARNING: Expected 1 policy, found %', policy_count;
  END IF;

  -- Count triggers on products table
  SELECT COUNT(*) INTO trigger_count
  FROM pg_trigger 
  WHERE tgrelid = 'products'::regclass;
  
  IF trigger_count = 0 THEN
    RAISE NOTICE 'SUCCESS: All triggers removed from products table';
  ELSE
    RAISE NOTICE 'WARNING: Expected 0 triggers, found %', trigger_count;
  END IF;

  RAISE NOTICE '=== COMPREHENSIVE PRODUCTS RLS FIX COMPLETE ===';
  RAISE NOTICE 'All policies and triggers removed';
  RAISE NOTICE 'Single permissive policy created for all operations';
  RAISE NOTICE 'Application must handle user isolation through created_by field';
END $$;

-- Step 8: Show final configuration
SELECT 
    tablename,
    policyname,
    cmd,
    permissive
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'products'
ORDER BY cmd, policyname;
