  # Fix RLS Policy for Auth0 Integration

  This script fixes the RLS policy issue when using Auth0 instead of Supabase Auth.
  
  Problem: RLS policies expect auth.uid() but Auth0 users don't have Supabase auth.uid()
  Solution: Create policies that work with Auth0 user IDs stored in created_by field
*/

-- First, let's see what policies currently exist
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    policyname,
    permissive,
    roles,
    cmd,

WHERE tablename = 'products';

-- Drop ALL existing policies for products table
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can read own products" ON products;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert own products" ON products;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own products" ON products;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete own products" ON products;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can manage products" ON products;

-- For Auth0 integration, we need to disable RLS or create very permissive policies
-- Since we're using Auth0, we'll trust the application to handle user isolation
-- Option 1: Disable RLS completely (if you trust your application)
-- ALTER TABLE products DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Option 2: Create permissive policies for authenticated users
-- This allows any authenticated user to manage products
-- The application will handle user isolation through the created_by field
CREATE POLICY "Auth0 users can manage products"
  ON products FOR ALL TO authenticated
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Create a trigger function to handle created_by for Auth0 users
-- Since we can't use auth.uid(), we'll let the application set created_by
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION handle_auth0_products()
RETURNS trigger AS $$
BEGIN
  -- For Auth0, we don't automatically set created_by since we don't have auth.uid()
  -- The application must provide the created_by field with the Auth0 user ID
